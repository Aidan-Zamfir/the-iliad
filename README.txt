Data analysis & relationship network for the characters of Homer's Iliad.


Web scraping was utilized to collect both character data & the text of The Iliad.

The NLP software spaCy was then used to parse through the text and find character name proximity to others & and
this frequency was used to determine the relationships between them.

of these relationships.
Built methods to find both community networks and degree centrality networks.
